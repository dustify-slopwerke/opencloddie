## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

First public release.

### Added

- Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` gateway
  to OpenCode Go, with SSE streaming, header forwarding, session affinity,
  per-key rate limits, and optional fallback model.
- Per-user OpenCode keys, encrypted at rest, plus per-API-key model selection
  in the web UI.
- `opencloddie` client: first-run setup, tmux-backed Claude Code sessions,
  detached agents, detach/reattach, and a standalone Python implementation.
- Web terminal over WebSocket with PTY resize, multiple sessions, and
  tabbed switching.
- tmux paste-buffer retrieval for selections made with tmux mouse mode, with
  clipboard fallbacks (manual text dialog and download).
- Web UI with burger navigation, live session tabs, API-key management,
  OpenCode settings, and model picker.
- nginx + Authelia integration, multi-arch Docker image, compose examples,
  and a systemd unit.
- 65 offline tests (unit, API, gateway SSE, client/agent end-to-end), CI, and
  comprehensive architecture, API, security, deployment, and troubleshooting
  documentation.

### Fixed

- `tmux attach` now receives `SIGWINCH` via `TIOCSCTTY`, so browser resizes
  actually resize tmux.
- Session tabs keep a stable order instead of re-sorting on every heartbeat.
- Agent read timeout no longer races the heartbeat and reconnects every few
  minutes.
- Clipboard copy works from xterm selections, the visible screen, and the tmux
  paste buffer.
